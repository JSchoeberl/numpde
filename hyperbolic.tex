Wave phenomena are are described by PDEs involving second order time derivatives:
$$
\frac{\partial^2 u(x,t)}{\partial t^2} - \opdiv (a(x) \nabla u) = f
$$
They require two initial conditions 
\begin{eqnarray*}
u(x,0) & = & u_0(x), \\
\frac{\partial u(x,t)}{\partial t} & = & v_0(x).
\end{eqnarray*}

Space discretization is accoring to parablic problems, and lead to the second order
ODE
$$
M u^{\prime \prime}(t) + A u(t) = f,
$$
and initial conditions
$$
u(0) = u_0 \qquad u^\prime(0) = v_0.
$$
By introducing a new function $v = u^\prime$, the second order ODE can be reduced to
the first order system
\begin{eqnarray*}
u^\prime & = & v \\
M v^\prime & = & f - A u,
\end{eqnarray*}
and initial conditions
$$
u(0) = u_0 \qquad v(0) = v_0.
$$
Time integration methods for first order systems can be applied.
